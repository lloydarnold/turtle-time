Inspiration for this project was the language logo, which I dabbled in during my first exploits into the world of computing

### Command set is as follows: 
  N.B. Commands are given in camelcase but program isn't case sensitive. N in all cases is positive integer - program will complain if given negatives or floats.

|Right n | RT n | Turn turtle n degrees to its right (clockwise) |
